The paper “**Demographic differences in perceived benefits from gamification**” has examined the effects of age, gender, and time using the service on perceived benefits from gamifying exercise by participating in a gamification service. Perceptions of facilitating factors and social, hedonic, and utilitarian benefits were measured.

Today, gamification is being applied in several areas (Hamari, Koivisto, & Sarsa, 2014), often for the benefit of users. For example, services such as Mindbloom, Fitocracy, Zombies, Run!, and Nike+ are aimed at assisting the user toward beneficial behavior related to lifestyle and health choices.

However, it is unclear whether we can see age and gender discrepancies in use of gamified services similar to those in other digital gaming contexts. The main difference between games and gamification is that gamification is commonly used to advance goals outside the game – e.g., supporting healthier lifestyles, greener consumption, and better financial decision-making – whereas playing games is considered purely autotelic or intrinsically motivated. Therefore, the motivations and the perceived benefits from gamification require further examination. No data exist on user demographics for gamification services, which further justifies the current undertaking.

This paper contributes to the growing body of literature on age and gender in gaming by investigating age and gender differences in perceived benefits from use of gamification. The study presents empirical data on the effects of gender, age, and time using the service on the social, hedonic, and utilitarian benefits from gamifying exercise, along with the facilitating factors in a gamification service with social features.

The responses gathered by the online survey are, obviously, self-reported and the respondents self-selected. Use of self-reported data is likely to affect the results as the users responding are most probably actively engaged with the service, and eager to participate in activities related to it. Thus, the results potentially represent perceptions and intentions of active users of the service and disregard less active and unengaged users.

As is commonplace within the industry, specific details regarding the user base or its size are not public knowledge. Thus, the study is limited with regards to reporting data concerning the general population from which the sample was gathered, that is, the user base of the service.
