The paper "**Usability Evaluation of Social Media Web Sites and Applications via EyeTracking Method**" describes usability studies of website-based and mobile application-based social media sites.In this study, how the users implement the activities that they want to perform in social media such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn are evaluated. The study aims to evaluate usability by analyzing information about how, how long and which results the participants perform the assigned tasks. With the data obtained from the study results, it is aimed to reveal incomplete and non-functional aspects of Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn websites and their mobile applications.

The study model was designated as a case study. The case study method is used to longitudinally investigate a case or an event in detail rather than to investigate a limited number of variables and to follow certain rules. Case studies are the studies to look at what happens in real environment, to collect data systematically, to analyze and to reveal results (Davey, 1991). In the study, 5 tasks were given to the participants for each Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn websites and mobile applications. While they were performing these tasks, their eye movements were recorded. The interviews were carried out with semistructured interview method after participants completed the tasks.

According to the results, the users can complete most of the tasks, but completion time varied. The participants had difficulties completing settings menu tasks except menus previously used in social media. When eye tracking results were examined, it was revealed that they mostly focused on the left side of websites and mobile applications. The participants stated that mobile applications were more useful than websites. According to eye-tracking data obtained in the study and the users’ opinions, mobile social media applications were more functional than their websites.

Eye movements provides important information about detecting the strategies of users. In the design of a website interface, eye tracking data can provide information about where people pay attention, which information they ignore, and what they are mostly disturbed by.This approach can be used for reference in future usability evaluation studies, so I think this paper is worth reading.
